Eagle Track
A simple inventory tracking application built using React JS.

By Chris Ndegwa

Description
Eagle Track is a modern inventory management app that allows users to manage their items, including adding, editing, deleting, and searching for items. The application utilizes core React concepts such as:

React Hooks for state management (useState, useEffect).
React Router for navigation between different pages.
Styled Components for dynamic theming.
Axios for API requests to a backend server.
The app is fully functional, supporting both dark and light themes and providing an intuitive UI for managing inventory.
