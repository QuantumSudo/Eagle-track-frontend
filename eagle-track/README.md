# Eagle Track

Eagle Track is a simple inventory tracking application built using React JS.

### By Chris Ndegwa

## Description

Eagle Track is a modern inventory management app that allows users to manage their items. It includes features such as adding, editing, deleting, and searching for items. The application uses core React concepts and modern web technologies, including:

- **React Hooks** for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **React Router** for navigation between pages
- **Styled Components** for dynamic theming
- **Axios** for making API requests to a backend server

The app is fully functional, supporting both dark and light themes and providing an intuitive UI for managing inventory.
